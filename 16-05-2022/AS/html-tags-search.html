    <h1>b tag</h1>
    <p>
      The b tag creates a little bolder version of a text line. It adds some
      thickness to the font of the text. We do use it for taking the attention
      of viewers or readers. Like if we want to use a para heading or an
      important thing, we can use the b tag there. Also, CSS font-weight does
      the same, there is much more reliable to make bold more and more.
    </p>
    <h4>Example :</h4>
    <p>This is a sentences and here <b>code</b> word is in bold format</p>
    <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p>
      The i tag helps us to create an italic font for the text. It also takes
      the viewer's attention to this. If we want to highlight some word or want
      to make some special word between sentences then i tag helps a lot. We use
      it for making "Technical terms", "Alternative voice or mood", "Taxonomic
      designations", "Transliterations", and a lot more things. We can use the
      CSS property as well for the same.
    </p>
    <h4>Example :</h4>
    <p>This is a sentences and here <i>code</i> word is in italic format</p>
    <h1>u tag</h1>
    <p>
      Along with other pure styling elements u tag creates an underline of a
      text. It also makes special words between text. It has the opening and
      closing tag. We can use the CSS text-decoration property as well for the
      same.
    </p>
    <h4>Example :</h4>
    <p>This is a sentences and here <u>code</u> word is in underline format</p>
    <h1>select tag</h1>
    <p>
      The select tag gives the option to select our choice. When we have a lot
      of things under a single category, and we have to choose a specific or
      multiple then select tag helping us to do that. We also can use different
      properties under this tag, id, label, multiple, autofocus, required,
      disable, and many more. For storing multi-option under select, we use
      another tag option. It also has value, selected, optgroup, and other
      property.
    </p>
    <h4>Example :</h4>
    <select name="cars" id="car_id">
      <option value="">Select car</option>
      <option value="bmw">BMW</option>
      <option value="audi">Audi</option>
      <option value="rolls royce">Rolls Royce</option>
      <option value="lamborghini">Lamborghini</option>
    </select>
    <h1>button tag</h1>
    <p>
      The button tag also creates an important role in HTML. If need any kind of
      action or event or click on our web page, the button helps us to create a
      great visual effect on that. It has some properties to make it more
      functional, type, name, value, disable, autocomplete, autofocus, and many
      more. We can use CSS on the button to colorization and looks more
      attractive and behavior on that.
    </p>
    <h4>Example :</h4>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </body>
</html>
